### Why This Stack

- **Next.js 15 + React 19** — App Router, Server Components, API routes, Middleware-level access protection, optimized asset pipeline, seamless Vercel deployment.
- **Clerk v7** — Zero-boilerplate auth with pre-built components (SignIn, SignUp, UserButton), JWT integration with Convex, and middleware route protection.
- **Convex** — Reactive serverless database with persistent WebSocket sync. UI updates instantly when data changes — no polling, no manual refetches.
- **Groq + Llama 3.3 70b** — LPU-accelerated inference generates deep structured resume analysis in under a second.
- **Zod v4** — Validates and type-checks every LLM JSON response at the API boundary, ensuring type safety end-to-end.
- **Zustand** — Lightweight client state for analysis loading phases and UI orchestration.
- **Tailwind v4 + CSS Custom Properties** — Utility-first styling with design tokens and 3-tier dark mode (explicit class, system preference, FOUC-prevention script).
- **Framer Motion** — Page transitions, modal enter/exit animations, sidebar slide-in, scroll reveal.

---

## Features

- **Dark Mode** — Full light/dark theme with localStorage persistence, system preference detection, and a blocking inline script that prevents flash of unstyled content (FOUC). Toggle in both the landing navbar and dashboard sidebar.

- **Kanban Applications Board** — Grid-based pipeline (Wishlist, Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected) with real-time status transitions, search/filter, and match score badges.

- **AI Resume Analysis** — Evaluates your resume against a job description and returns:
  - **Match Score & Fit Level** — Numerical score (0–100) with breakdown across technical skills, experience, keyword match, and seniority fit.
  - **Score Breakdown** — Radar-ready sub-scores for each dimension.
  - **Keyword Coverage** — Categorized matched/missing keywords with importance levels and context.
  - **Strengths & Gaps** — Direct comparison highlighting achievements and missing credentials.
  - **Bullet Rewrites** — Side-by-side original vs. suggested text with professional rationale.
  - **Structure Suggestions** — Section-level recommendations (summary, experience, education, etc.) with priority.
  - **Skill Roadmap** — Prioritized skill recommendations with learning resources.
  - **Action Items** — Critical/recommended/optional next steps with impact and effort estimates.
  - **ATS Check** — ATS compatibility score with formatting issues and severity warnings.
  - **Cover Letter Draft** — Generated 2–3 paragraph cover letter.
  - **Interview Coach** — Role-specific questions with strategy advice and difficulty ratings.

- **Analysis Diff** — When re-analyzing an application, shows a diff between the previous and new result, highlighting what changed.

- **Side-by-Side 3-Column Tailoring Workspace** — Left panel for application metadata and resume selection, center panel for editing resume copy, right panel for the target job description.

- **Multi-Resume Template Manager** — Create, edit, and store multiple resume versions. Mark a default for auto-loading into the tailoring workspace.

---

## Security

- **Clerk Middleware** — Protects `/dashboard/*`, `/application-board/*`, `/resume-templates/*`, and `/api/compare` behind authentication.
- **API Key Fallback** — The `/api/compare` endpoint can be called without a Clerk session by passing an `x-api-key` header matching the `API_KEY` env var (optional).
- **JWT Verification** — Convex validates incoming WebSocket handshakes against Clerk's JWT issuer for zero unauthorized data access.
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation** — Every database query filters by Clerk user ID (`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`), preventing cross-user leakage.
- **Zod Validation** — All LLM output is validated and sanitized through Zod schemas before reaching the database or UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (or Bun 1.0+)
- Accounts: [Clerk](https://clerk.com), [Groq](https://console.groq.com), [Convex](https://convex.dev)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1ewig/apply-ai-full-stack.git
cd apply-ai-full-stack
bun install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your credentials:

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com) → API Keys |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com) → API Keys |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Same |
| `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` | Clerk Dashboard → Configure → JWT Templates → Convex template → Issuer |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` | Printed by `npx convex dev` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL` | Printed by `npx convex dev` |

### 3. Start Convex

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This deploys the backend functions and prints your Convex URLs.

### 4. Run Dev Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.
